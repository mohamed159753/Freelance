## Projects
### Data Scraping with Python

I am working on an Android app that compares food prices from different retailers. To support this, I needed to build a Python scraping script using Flask that returns the prices of items based on users' choices to the app. This task was challenging because the search mechanisms of the retailers vary significantly. However, I managed to standardize and clean the data to achieve the desired functionality.

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed a robust web scraping script using Python.
- Integrated Flask to serve the scraped data to the Android app.
- Implemented data cleaning and standardization techniques to handle diverse retailer formats.
- Enhanced the search and comparison mechanism to provide accurate and timely price comparisons.

### Discord Bot for "Undercover/Mr. White" Game

I developed a Discord bot that mimics the popular "Undercover/Mr. White" game, using Python. This bot enhances the gaming experience by automating the game mechanics and providing an engaging platform for players to enjoy the game directly within their Discord servers.

**Game Overview:**
"Undercover/Mr. White" is a social deduction game where players are assigned different roles. Most players are given a common word, while one or more players (the Undercover agents) receive a different word that is related but distinct. Additionally, one player may be assigned the role of Mr. White, who must guess the common word to win. Players take turns giving one-word clues to hint at their word without revealing it outright. The objective is to identify the Undercover agents and Mr. White while avoiding being eliminated.

**Key Features:**
- Automates the "Undercover/Mr. White" game, handling player roles, game flow, and win conditions.
- Utilizes Python to build robust and maintainable bot functionalities.
- Integrates seamlessly with Discord, providing an intuitive and interactive user experience.
- Offers customizable game settings, allowing server administrators to tailor the game to their preferences.
- Ensures fair play by randomly assigning roles and managing game state transparently.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Developed using Discord.py, a powerful library for creating Discord bots in Python.
- Implemented state management to handle various stages of the game, ensuring smooth transitions.
- Utilized asynchronous programming to handle multiple game sessions simultaneously.
- Designed a user-friendly command system to interact with the bot effortlessly.

This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive and engaging applications using Python and showcases my skills in bot development and game design.

### Design Projects

In addition to my programming projects, I have a strong interest in design, which I pursue as a hobby. I have worked on various design projects, ranging from graphic design to user interface design.
